# Dotfiles

Alas, I find it too difficult to install nix on some systems...so this repo contains autogenerated/exported config and script files that have been scrubbed of nix paths so they still work.

The nix configuration that these are generated from can be found at:  
[https://github.com/WildfireXIII/nix-config](https://github.com/WildfireXIII/nix-config)
